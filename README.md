Long ago when people wanted to be heard, they would stand on a SoapBox and
holler. We believe our SoapBox gives the modern user a step up when it comes to
being heard and hearing others. We aggregate data about issues taking into
account proximity, friends, whats trending, and advanced machine learning to

Relevant XKCD is a web app that uses Google App Engine and Google's Prediction
API to accurately find relevant XKCD's given key words and phrases or context
from a conversation. The website will display comics based on their relevancy,
and you can then train the prediction set by indicating whether the comic that
it produced was relevant. The web app can then be used as the basis for
a Reddit.com bot that can post relevant XKCD's based on the context of comments
from posts, and be trained based on the amount of upvotes it recieves.

Assimilator is a JavaScript add-on that brings up articles based on the current
website the user is on. For example, a person on the Tesla website looking at

The below submissions are **currently in presentation order** with Sponsor
prizes in between.


## [Flash Feed](http://mhacks.challengepost.com/submissions/17431-flash-feed)
### By Brad Dwyer [@braddwyer](https://twitter.com/braddwyer)

Flash Feed lets you ask your Page's fans questions and receive responses via
a post's comments. The backend listens to the realtime updates stream from
Facebook and replies to comments programmatically based on their content.

It also uses the "Feed Gaming" api in a creative way to display poll results as
a post attachment. This enables users to interact with the brand without having
to give up personal information or go through an OAuth flow. This integration
was inspired by Ribbon's

## [Tabbr](http://mhacks.challengepost.com/submissions/17469-tabbr)
### By Peter Xiao [@pterxiao](https://github.com/pterxiao)

![tabbr screenshot](http://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/photos/production/solution_photos/000/064/387/datas/xlarge.png?1379854501)

tabbr is a search engine for tabs. Navigating to a tab slows down with more
tabs. Instead, tabbr jumps directly to the tab you want by searching for it.
A ranking algorithm will select the tab you want based on many factors, such as
keywords in the tab content, tab title, tab url, frequency of accesses, most
recently used, and other factors.

## [Cloud Contacts](http://mhacks.challengepost.com/submissions/17540-cloud-contacts)

![cloud contacts screenshot](http://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/photos/production/solution_photos/000/064/565/datas/xlarge.png?1379857227)

Exchanging contacts can be a pain at any networking event. By crowd sourcing
contact information, we make getting someone's number as easy as typing their
name into a search box. We use twilio to accept "contact requests" even for
those who don't have the app. We built the back end off Parse for a scalable
solution that will take us beyond our first 3 thousand contacts to millions
around the nation.

Our iPhone App is a suite of services that use the I/O devices of the phone in
unique ways. It features a "Friction Finder": a service that uses the
accelerometer to find the coefficient of friction between the phone and another
surface by sliding the phone along it. It also has a "Record Player" that uses
the phone's gyroscope; you can play music at variable speed by spinning your
phone about the z-axis.


## [GreenCan](http://mhacks.challengepost.com/submissions/17562-greencan)
### By Joshua Drubin [@Drubadubdub](https://twitter.com/Drubadubdub)

![GreenCan screenshot](http://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/photos/production/solution_photos/000/064/692/datas/xlarge.png?1379857802)

A trashcan that sorts items into recyclables and non-recyclables based on the
sound that the item makes as it enters the trashcan.

This prototype uses the sound that a material makes when it hits a platform to
determine what the material is, and based on that information, determines
whether or not the item is recyclable.

HUD/Safety features for driving with Google Glass. Also uses weather underground.
HUD Features Display of MPH, RPM, Weather, as well as the speed limit for the 
current road. When Glass recognizes that you're nodding off behind the wheel, it 
flashes red and sounds an alarm in your ear to wake you up. In the event that Glass

immediately and calls 911.

holding an object by slightly restricting the movements of fingers pulling them
with a servo mounted on the glove.
